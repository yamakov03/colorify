## Security Policy

### Personal data

colorify had never collected and will never collect any personal data, browsing history etc.

In the future, Colorify may gather information such as your browser version, platform name, display settings, and filter preferences (excluding the website list or any data that could identify you). This data will be used for introducing new features, discontinuing unused ones, or proposing default settings for newcomers. Rest assured, any such data collection will only occur with your permission.

### Third party services

colorify uses the Chrome (Chromium) or WebExtensions Storage Sync API to store user settings, and the browser’s Web Storage API (localStorage) to keep track of user’s Developer Tools adjustments.

Donations are handled by Buy Me a Coffee, along with the payment processors selected by this organization.

Any security vulnerability discovered in colorify will be fixed as soon as possible with as minimal impact as possible when reported.

Please ensure you are always running the latest version available.
