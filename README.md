## Using colorify for a website

You can use colorify to change the look of a website by selecting an element on the screen or entering a CSS selector. Upon opening the extension you'll be greeted by a popup that looks like this:

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/docs/example.png" width="200" alt="colorify example" >
</div>

After clicking "select by click," you can hover over and select the element on your current page, outlined in red. All elements are selectable, including text, images, and buttons, and persist across page reloads. Your settings are even saved across devices if you use Chrome Sync.

Search websites that have selected elements using the search bar. You can set the initial background and text color for selected elements by selecting the cog in the top right corner. 

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/docs/example1.png" width="200" alt="colorify example" >
</div>

You'll also find the option to clear all elements, which will remove all selected elements from all pages. Deleting elements is easy! Click the red icon to clear all elements from a website, or remove them individually by clicking the X next to the element.
